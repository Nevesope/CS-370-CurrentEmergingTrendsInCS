Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project we created a code where we had an AI agent play a maze against a human. The end goal was to get the treasure at the ending. The piece of code we asssisted with was the involvment of the agent responding to this "path finding" problem. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

A computer scientist changes and helps us a create things that will benefit us on the future. Without this job there wouldn't be so many tihngs we rely on today. When approaching a problem like a computer scientist were able to take such deep dives into a subject and use our problem solving skills to assist. The main purpose of this job is problem solving and using this as a tool in every scenario. Our ethical responsibilty is to keep the users safe, there is many more ethical responsibilties however this is the most important.
